### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a 2nd year student at Pamukkale University Computer Engineering Department. I have been interested in software development for 3 years. I am proficient in C, Java, and Python languages. Additionally, I possess advanced knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms. I solve algorithm questions on platforms such as LeetCode and Codewars.
Recently, I have been doing research in the field of statistics and using these researches in my projects.
